#Art of San Francisco

##Background:

Art of San Francisco is a web-based map application that helps the user to explore and learn about the many amazing public art locations that the city has to offer. For this map, I plan to have a map of the city divided into each of its neighborhoods. The map will display the locations of public art pieces and allow the user to select neighborhoods as well as specific locations, which will display information and pictures on the subject.

Once a neighborhood is selected, the map will display a zoomed-in sub map of the selected neighborhood enlarged, with a clickable pin for each public art display. Clicking the pin will display a picture and some information about the art piece. 


##Functionality and MVPs:


In Art of San Francisco, users will be able to:

1)Zoom in and zoom out 
2)Reset and recenter their map
3)Click on neighborhoods
4)Click on pins representing art locations
5)Exit out of the view display for a art location and/or neighborhood
6)Click on external links to learn more about a location

In addition, this project will include:

* A page of all the links and sources of the data
* Change the color of certain display aspects
* View data comparing the neighborhoods


##Wireframes:

##Libraries and APIs:

* d3 JS library for 
* Sfgov.org API
* html/css
*  Vanilla Javascript
* Possibly Canvas API for dividing the city into neighborhoods
* Wikipedia for additional info on locations



##Implementation Timeline:

* 12/31 Thursday
  * Figure out what tools from d3 library to use 
  * Get access to city API and familiarize with accessing 
* 1/3 Monday
  * Draw/import map of neighborhoods
* Create template for displaying single art location info
  * 1/4 Tuesday
* Work on CSS/HTML for display and smooth transitions
  * 1/5 Wednesday
  * See what other external resources could be added and polish
* 1/6 Thursday
  * Finish testing functionality and ensuring all locations have info



##Bonus Features:

* Could add in some data and statistics to compare the neighborhoods and their art. Such as how old on average the art is, what types of art is most common, which neighborhood has the highest density and concentration.

* I could also add links to websites about the artists, show more pictures of each picture and add more personalized text and info for each location.
